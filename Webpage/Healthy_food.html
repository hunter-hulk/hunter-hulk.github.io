                <h1>Whole Eggs Are Among the Most Nutritious Foods on Earth.</h1>   
                One whole egg contains an amazing range of nutrients.
                <br>
                In fact, the nutrients in there are enough to turn a single fertilized cell into an entire baby chicken.
                <br>
                Eggs are loaded with vitamins, minerals, high-quality protein, good fats and various other lesser-known
                nutrients.
                <br>
                One large egg contains:
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Vitamin B12 (cobalamin): 9% of the RDA</li>
                    <li>Vitamin B2 (riboflavin): 15% of the RDA</li>
                    <li>Vitamin A: 6% of the RDA</li>
                    <li>Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid): 7% of the RDA</li>
                    <li>Selenium: 22% of the RDA</li>
                </ul>
                Eggs also contain small amounts of almost every vitamin and mineral required by the human body,
                including calcium, iron, potassium, zinc, manganese, vitamin E, folate and many more.
                <br>
                A large egg contains 77 calories, with 6 grams of quality protein, 5 grams of fat and trace amounts of
                carbohydrates.
                <br>
                It’s very important to realize that almost all the nutrients are contained in the yolk, the white
                contains only protein.

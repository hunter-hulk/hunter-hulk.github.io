                <h1>Reasons Why Eggs Are the Healthiest Food on the Planet</h1>
                One whole egg contains an amazing range of nutrients.
                <br>
                In fact, the nutrients in there are enough to turn a single fertilized cell into an entire baby chicken.
                <br>
                Eggs are loaded with vitamins, minerals, high-quality protein, good fats and various other lesser-known
                nutrients.
                <br>
                One large egg contains:

                <ul>
                    <li>Vitamin B12 (cobalamin): 9% of the RDA</li>
                    <li>Vitamin B2 (riboflavin): 15% of the RDA</li>
                    <li>Vitamin A: 6% of the RDA</li>
                    <li>Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid): 7% of the RDA</li>
                    <li>Selenium: 22% of the RDA</li>
                </ul>
                Eggs also contain small amounts of almost every vitamin and mineral required by the human body,
                including calcium, iron, potassium, zinc, manganese, vitamin E, folate and many more.
                <br>
                A large egg contains 77 calories, with 6 grams of quality protein, 5 grams of fat and trace amounts of
                carbohydrates.
                <br>
                It’s very important to realize that almost all the nutrients are contained in the yolk, the white
                contains only protein.

                <h1>Evidence-Based Health Benefits of Bananas</h1>
                Bananas are among the world’s most popular fruits.
                <br>
                Native to Southeast Asia, they are now grown in many warm parts of the world.
                <br>
                Bananas vary in color, size and shape.
                <br>
                The most common type is the Cavendish, which is a type of dessert banana. Green when unripe, it yellows
                as it matures.
                <br>
                Bananas contain a fair amount of fiber, as well as several antioxidants. One medium-sized banana (118
                grams) also boasts (1, 2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source):
                <ul>
                    <li>Potassium: 9% of the RDI</li>
                    <li> Vitamin B6: 33% of the RDI</li>
                    <li>Vitamin C: 11% of the RDI</li>
                    <li>Magnesium: 8% of the RDI</li>
                    <li>Copper: 10% of the RDI</li>
                    <li>Manganese: 14% of the RDI</li>
                    <li>Net carbs: 24 grams</li>
                    <li>Fiber: 3.1 grams</li>
                    <li>Protein: 1.3 grams</li>
                    <li>Fat: 0.4 grams</li>
                </ul>
                Each banana has only about 105 calories and consists almost exclusively of water and carbs. Bananas
                hold
                very little protein and almost no fat.
                <br>
                The carbs in green, unripe bananas consist mostly of starch and resistant starch, but as the banana
                ripens, the starch turns into sugar (glucose, fructose and sucrose).
